    <p id="personal-info">Hi, my name is Augustus (usually Gus) Murphy. I’m excited to be submitting my application to Prime Digital Academy—something I’ve considered off and on for the past four years, but am finally pulling the trigger on. I’ve enjoyed teaching myself a few different programming skills, and would love the opportunity to be able to focus on my education and starting a career.</p>

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <h4>Lawrence University, Bachelor of Music, Trombone Performance, Class of 2015</h4>
      <p>I began my time at Lawrence as a Math-Computer Science major, and dabbled in whatever music I could do as a non-major. By the end of my first year, I realized that my interest in music was much deeper, and added the Trombone Performance major to my degree. Eventually, I realized I had to choose between understanding differential equations and understanding bebop, and only graduated with the Bachelor of Music degree, but do not regret the foundational experience I gained in those math and computer science classes. In fact, the deeper I got into both fields, the more I realized I was attracted to elements common to both: abstract thinking, undefined problems, and recognizing patterns.</p>
